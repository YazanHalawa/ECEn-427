/**
*
* This function does a minimal test on the UartLite device and driver as a
* design example. The purpose of this function is to illustrate
* how to use the XUartLite component.
*
* This function sends data and expects to receive the same data through the
* UartLite. The user must provide a physical loopback such that data which is
* transmitted will be received.
*
* This function uses interrupt driver mode of the UartLite device. The calls
* to the UartLite driver in the handlers should only use the non-blocking
* calls.
*
* @param	DeviceId is the Device ID of the UartLite Device and is the
*		XPAR_<uartlite_instance>_DEVICE_ID value from xparameters.h.
*
* @return	XST_SUCCESS if successful, otherwise XST_FAILURE.
*
* @note
*
* This function contains an infinite loop such that if interrupts are not
* working it may never return.
